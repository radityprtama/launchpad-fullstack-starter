# LaunchPad Application Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor arrives at the LaunchPad platform, they land on the public marketing page at the root URL. This page briefly explains the core features of LaunchPad and displays a clear call to action to either sign up or sign in. Tapping the sign up link takes the visitor to the sign-up page, where they can register using their email address and password. They enter their desired credentials and submit the form. The system performs server-side validation to ensure the email is well formed and the password meets minimum security requirements. Upon successful registration, the user is automatically signed in and redirected to the main dashboard.

If an existing user clicks the sign in link on the landing page, they are taken to the sign-in page. Here they provide their registered email and password. The authentication system checks the credentials and, if valid, establishes a session and redirects the user to the dashboard. Should the user forget their password, a “Forgot Password” link is available on the sign-in page. Clicking this link prompts the user to enter their email address, and the system sends a password reset email containing a secure token. Following the link in that email brings the user to a password reset form, where they enter a new password and confirm it. Upon submission, the password is updated, and the user is redirected to the sign-in page with a success message.

Signing out is available from any page via a prominent “Sign Out” button in the header. Clicking it ends the user session and returns them to the public landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user arrives on the LaunchPad dashboard at `/app/dashboard`. The page is wrapped in a consistent layout that features a top navigation bar containing the application logo on the left and the user avatar with a dropdown menu on the right. The dropdown menu includes navigation links such as “Templates”, “Teams”, “Settings”, and “Billing”, as well as the “Sign Out” button. On the left side of the screen, a collapsible sidebar lists the same navigation sections for quick access.

The main area of the dashboard defaults to the Templates overview. It greets the user by name and presents a table of their personal and team templates. Each template row shows the name, creation date, and a set of actions such as “Edit”, “Use Template”, and “Delete”. A prominent “New Template” button sits above the table to start creating a new template. The dashboard header includes a search field to filter templates by name.

From this dashboard view, the user can navigate to the Teams section by selecting “Teams” in the sidebar. They can also reach Settings or Billing pages by clicking the respective links in the top navigation dropdown or sidebar.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The core modules of LaunchPad are the Template Builder, Project Generation, Team Management, and Billing Integration. Each flows seamlessly from the dashboard.

### Visual Template Builder

When the user clicks “New Template” or selects “Edit” on an existing template, they are taken to `/app/dashboard/templates/[id?]`. This single-page interface loads a multi-pane layout. The left pane displays a file tree where the user can add folders and files. Clicking a file opens an editor in the center pane where they can input content with placeholder variables. The right pane provides a variable definition panel listing each placeholder name, a description field, and a default value input. As the user makes changes, a preview button at the bottom renders a sample project structure. Saving the template triggers a POST or PUT API call to `/api/templates` with the template payload. On success, the user is returned to the Templates overview with a confirmation banner.

### Project Generation Flow

From the Templates overview, the user clicks “Use Template” on a row. This action opens a modal overlay that prompts for the new project name and any variable overrides. The user fills out the form and clicks “Generate”. The client sends a POST request to `/api/generate` containing the template ID, project name, and variable values. The server validates the request with Zod and enqueues a job in the background queue. The modal switches to a progress view and listens for real-time updates via WebSockets. When the background worker picks up the job, it retrieves the template definition, runs the templating engine to generate files, and uses the user’s stored GitHub OAuth token to create a new repository and push the code. As each step completes, the server pushes status updates back to the modal. On final success, the modal displays a link to the new GitHub repository and a button to close. The user closes the modal and sees an entry in their activity log on the dashboard.

### Team Management and Collaboration

Selecting “Teams” in the sidebar opens the Teams overview page at `/app/dashboard/teams`. Here the user sees a list of teams they own or belong to. A button labeled “Create Team” takes them to a form to enter a team name and invite members by email. Submitting this form calls the `/api/teams` endpoint, which creates a new team record and sends invitation emails. Clicking on any team name navigates to the team detail page, where the user can see team members, manage roles, and adjust team-specific templates. Role changes and member removals are done inline via API calls to `/api/teams/[teamId]/members`. Returning to the Templates overview from a team page happens through the sidebar navigation.

### Billing and Subscription Plans

When the user selects “Billing” from the sidebar, they arrive at `/app/dashboard/billing`. This page displays their current plan—Free, Pro, or Team—along with usage metrics and billing history. A button labeled “Change Plan” opens a form that integrates with Stripe Checkout for upgrading or downgrading. The user selects a new plan and is redirected to the Stripe-hosted payment page. After completing payment, Stripe calls back to a webhook route at `/api/webhooks/stripe` to update the user’s subscription status in the database. The user is notified of successful subscription changes and sees the updated plan reflected on the billing page.

## Settings and Account Management

The user clicks “Settings” in the top navigation dropdown to access their account page at `/app/dashboard/settings`. The page displays personal profile fields such as name and email, which the user can edit and save. Password changes are managed under a separate tab within the settings page. Entering the current password and a new password triggers a PUT request to `/api/auth/update-password`. The user also configures notification preferences, choosing which emails or in-app alerts they wish to receive. Changes to notifications are sent to `/api/users/[userId]/preferences` and applied immediately. After saving settings, the user sees a success banner and can use the sidebar to return to Templates or any other section of the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user attempts to sign in with incorrect credentials, the sign-in form displays an inline error message indicating invalid email or password. During template creation or editing, server-side validation failures result in the form fields being highlighted with error messages explaining the required corrections. If the user loses network connectivity while interacting with the dashboard, an unobtrusive toast message appears alerting them to the offline state and disabling subsequent actions until the connection is restored. Attempting to access a restricted page, such as the Teams overview without proper permissions, displays a full-page 403 error with an explanation and a link back to the dashboard. Should the background project generation service encounter an unexpected error, the progress modal shows an error screen detailing the failure and a “Retry” button, which re-enqueues the job. In all error scenarios, the application ensures the user is guided back to a valid state without data loss.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the first visit to daily usage, the LaunchPad application guides the user through a seamless flow. A newcomer lands on the marketing page, signs up with email, and is quickly ushered into the dashboard. They create and manage templates using an intuitive visual builder before using those templates to generate real projects in their own GitHub account. Collaboration happens naturally through team creation and invitation workflows. Subscription tiers are clearly presented, and billing changes occur through a trusted Stripe integration. Profile updates and notification settings are just a click away, and all along, robust error handling ensures that users remain productive even in the face of network issues or unexpected failures. This end-to-end flow supports the typical goals of publishing new templates, spinning up codebases with a few clicks, and collaborating with team members on the LaunchPad platform.
