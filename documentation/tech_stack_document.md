# Tech Stack Document for LaunchPad

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices behind the **LaunchPad** Boilerplate-as-a-Service platform. It shows how each piece fits together and why we picked it, so anyone can understand how the product works under the hood.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

Our goal on the frontend is to build a fast, interactive, and consistent user experience for the LaunchPad dashboard and marketing pages. Here’s what we chose:

- **Next.js (App Router)**
  - A single framework for both pages and APIs.
  - Lets us share code and data types between the user interface and backend logic.
  - Simplifies routing for the marketing site, dashboard, and API calls.

- **TypeScript**
  - Adds type safety to JavaScript.
  - Catches errors early during development, making the code more reliable.

- **shadcn/ui**
  - A library of ready-made, accessible UI components (buttons, dialogs, tables).
  - Speeds up building complex interfaces like the Visual Template Builder.
  - Ensures a consistent look and feel across the entire app.

- **Tailwind CSS (v4)**
  - Utility-first styling library for rapid, consistent design.
  - Lets developers write small, reusable style classes directly in markup.

How this helps users:

- Fast page loads and smooth navigation.
- A polished, responsive dashboard that adapts to all devices.
- A professional interface built without reinventing design work.

## 2. Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, we need a robust system to manage users, store data, and power features like project generation.

- **Node.js & Next.js API Routes**
  - Runs our server code using the same framework as frontend.
  - Defines endpoints (e.g., `/api/templates`, `/api/generate`) to handle data requests.

- **Better Auth**
  - Complete user authentication and session management (sign-up, sign-in, roles).
  - Built-in support for freemium, Pro, and Team accounts.

- **PostgreSQL**
  - A reliable, open-source relational database.
  - Stores users, teams, templates, subscriptions, and job status.

- **Drizzle ORM**
  - A type-safe way to interact with PostgreSQL.
  - Ensures database queries and schema changes match our TypeScript types.

- **BullMQ & Redis** (for background jobs)
  - Handles long-running tasks like code generation and GitHub pushes.
  - Queues jobs so they don’t block real-time API responses.

How this helps users:

- Secure user accounts with flexible subscription controls.
- Reliable storage of templates and generation jobs.
- Fast responses for simple requests, with heavy work done in the background.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

We’ve built a streamlined process to develop, test, and deploy LaunchPad with minimal friction.

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
  - Containerizes the application, database, and worker services.
  - Guarantees the same setup in development, testing, and production.

- **Git & GitHub**
  - Version control for tracking code changes.
  - Collaboration through pull requests and code reviews.

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
  - Automatically tests and builds code on every commit.
  - Deploys to hosting platforms when changes are approved.

- **Hosting Platforms (e.g., Vercel or AWS)**
  - Hosts the frontend and API routes for global performance.
  - Can scale up as the user base grows.

How this helps users:

- Highly available service with minimal downtime.
- Quick updates and bug fixes rolled out automatically.
- Predictable environment that reduces “it works on my machine” issues.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

Leveraging external services speeds up development and adds powerful features.

- **Stripe**
  - Manages Free, Pro, and Team subscriptions and billing.
  - Handles payment processing securely.

- **GitHub OAuth / next-auth**
  - Allows users to connect their GitHub accounts.
  - Enables the “Push to Repo” feature for generated projects.

- **Analytics Tools (e.g., Google Analytics or PostHog)**
  - Tracks user behavior and feature usage.
  - Helps us make data-driven improvements.

How this helps users:

- Secure, PCI-compliant billing and subscription management.
- One-click integration with users’ GitHub accounts.
- Insights into how LaunchPad is used, leading to better features.

---

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Security and speed are top priorities to ensure users trust and enjoy the service.

Security Measures:
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Better Auth handles secure sign-up, login, and session tokens.
  - Role-based access control for freemium vs. paid features.

- **Data Validation with Zod**
  - Validates all inputs on the server to prevent malformed or malicious data.

- **Encrypted Connections**
  - Enforces HTTPS for all traffic.
  - Secure storage of user credentials and OAuth tokens.

Performance Optimizations:
- **Code Splitting & Caching**
  - Next.js automatically splits JavaScript by page for faster loads.
  - HTTP caching headers speed up repeat visits.

- **Background Processing**
  - Heavy tasks run in worker containers, keeping the UI responsive.

- **Connection Pooling**
  - Drizzle and PostgreSQL use pooled database connections to handle many users efficiently.

How this helps users:

- Smooth, uninterrupted experience even under load.
- Confidence that their data and payment details are secure.
- Fast initial loads and real-time feedback on actions.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The LaunchPad stack combines the best modern tools to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure Boilerplate-as-a-Service platform:

- Frontend: **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **shadcn/ui**, **Tailwind CSS**
- Backend: **Next.js API Routes**, **Node.js**, **Better Auth**, **PostgreSQL**, **Drizzle ORM**, **BullMQ** + **Redis**
- Infrastructure: **Docker**/**Docker Compose**, **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions**, **Vercel/AWS**
- Integrations: **Stripe**, **GitHub OAuth / next-auth**, **Analytics Tools**
- Security & Performance: **Zod validation**, **HTTPS**, **background workers**, **caching and code splitting**

Why these choices? They give us a single, unified framework (Next.js with TypeScript) that covers both frontend and backend, a type-safe database layer, out-of-the-box authentication, and a component library for a professional UI. Docker and CI/CD ensure reliable deployments, while third-party services like Stripe and GitHub OAuth add essential features without reinventing the wheel. 

Together, this stack accelerates development, ensures maintainability, and provides a seamless experience for end users building and managing their code templates with LaunchPad.
